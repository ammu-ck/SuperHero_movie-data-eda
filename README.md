## 📌 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Download & Load**
   - Dataset downloaded from Kaggle
   - Loaded using Pandas

2. **Data Understanding**
   - Used `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()` for exploration
   - Inspected missing and malformed data

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and non-numeric formats like `'48.06M'`, `'NaN M'`
   - Removed unnecessary rows and columns

4. **Feature**
   - Extracted and transformed relevant features
   - Grouped by publishers and years

5. **Visualization**
   - Used Seaborn & Matplotlib to create:
     - 📈 Line plots (average gross over years)
     - 📊 Bar charts (top publishers)
     - 🥧 Pie charts (segment/type distribution)
